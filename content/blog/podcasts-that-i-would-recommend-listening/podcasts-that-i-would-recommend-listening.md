description: When the Covid-19 outbreak started, I started to work from home as
  many people did.  I decided to invest more in broadening my knowledge since it
  is the best investment that you could possibly do. Also, I did not have to
  spend extra hours on the commute. Listening to the podcasts was one of the new
  things that I started to do.
