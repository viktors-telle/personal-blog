When the Covid-19 outbreak started, I started to work from home as many people did. It meant that I do not have to spend extra hours on the commute. So I decided to spend the saved time to invest more in broadening my knowledge in finance, entrepreneurship, and information technology. Investing in your knowledge is the best investment that you could do. Listening to the podcasts was one of the new things that I started to do.

Here is the list of the five podcasts that I listen to regularly. 

## We Study Billionaires

First, I wanted to understand finances better so I did the research and found a couple of promising podcasts. This is one of my favorites. It comes out every Sunday and informs you of the latest developments in economics and investing.

## Techmeme Ride Home

This podcast comes out every workday. Brian does a great job informing us of the latest technology news.

## The Web Platform Podcast

I am a web developer myself. It is only reasonable that I should find the podcast that talks about the latest trends in web development.

This podcast was founded in 2014 by HTML W3C invited expert Erik Isaksen.
