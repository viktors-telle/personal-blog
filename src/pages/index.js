      <p>
        My name is Viktors Telle, and I am a software developer from Latvia.
        I've been working in the industry for more than 14 years. I am a father
        of the two beautiful kids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I work as a senior software developer in a large enterprise
        company. Before that, I worked at a variety of companies ranging from
        small startups to midsize companies. My focus is primarily on developing
        applications using .NET Core and SPA frameworks like React and Angular.
        I have experience in creating up CI/CD pipelines in TeamCity, Octopus
        Deploy, and Azure DevOps. I also have experience in coaching and
        mentoring other developers for the last five years. I am a big fan of
        clean code, best practices, and quality software.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write a <Link to="/blog/">blog</Link> where I share my work experience
        and try to help people to learn from my mistakes. It is known for a fact
        that the fastest and the best way to learn is to learn from someone
        else's mistakes and experiences. I also share the best practices in
        software development. Besides writing and spending time with my kids, I
        also study the finances and entrepreneurship by reading books and
        listening to various podcasts.
      </p>

        If you want to reach me, please send me a message via
        <Link to="/contact/"> contact form. </Link>I can advise on the
        development best practices, how to improve legacy code base, how to
        automate your build and deployment pipeline, or other software
        development topics.
